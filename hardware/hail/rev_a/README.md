Hardware files
==============

Hail was created in [Eagle](https://cadsoft.io/) and the `hail.sch` and
`hail.brd` files are Eagle schematic and board files respectively.

`hail_bom.xlsx` is the Bill of Materials (list of parts). It is also provided
as `.txt` and `.csv` files for convenience.

`panel/` contains the files needed to create a panel of 20 (4 x 5) Hail boards.
Ordering panels of boards reduces the individual board costs.
