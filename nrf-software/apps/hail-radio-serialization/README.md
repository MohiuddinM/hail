Nordic Serialization Application
================================

This application runs on an nRF51822 and allows it to receive softdevice
commands over a UART connection from another microcontroller. In practice, this
app allows the SAM4L to run an application which calls Nordic SDKs in order to
use the BLE protocol through the nRF51822.
